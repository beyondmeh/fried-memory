Arcade game where you play as a virus trying to infect a system, but beware of the anti-virus program!

This aims to be a open-source clone of a old Windows shareware game called "[Virus: The Game](http://www.mobygames.com/game/virus-the-game_)" by DynoTech Software.

I loved this game as a kid, but it was pretty obscure, partly due to being overshadowed by the [Sir-Tech game of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus%3A_The_Game) that used dubious advertising resulting in negative reviews.

**NOTE:** *This is just a fun little game, not real malware!*
